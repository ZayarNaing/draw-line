# draw-line
## To draw a line on an image

```python draw_line.py --img <path-to-image> --save <directory where yaml file will be saved> --name <name of yaml file>```

## How to draw?
- Left Click on the mouse to mark a point anywhere on the image. The second click would complete a line.
- After the line is completed and you click again, the line will disappear and a point will be marked again. 
- Press 'q' or 'ENTER' to quit the program.
- Press 'r' or 'c' to reset the window.
- When you quit in the middle of drawing a line (after first point and before second point), the program will not save the points to yaml file.
